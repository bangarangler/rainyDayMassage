            Hi! Iâ€™m Kaitlyn Hofmann LMT#13280 and ACE massage cupping certified
            therapist. I am also the proud mommy of a wonderfully weird 8 year
            old girl and a 4 year old furbaby. I fell in love with massage
            therapy almost 5 years ago during my first class in massage therapy.
            I had no idea what I was getting into or how true to myself this
            profession would be. Over the years I have learned new techniques
            and modalities so that I could customize my clients experience with
            every session. I love what I do and truly enjoy sharing the benefits
            of Massage!
